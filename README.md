# Database-Management-Systems-Project


## General Information

We had to create a mini database system for our project in DMBS. Unfortunately we were only allowed to use
C , C++ or Java. I am not good at any of those languages lol. I had to learn C++ and write this code in a few
hours so it's a single monolith file.
